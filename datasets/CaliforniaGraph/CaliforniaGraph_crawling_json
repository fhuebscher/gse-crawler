      "Nayla Abney took a chance leaving New Jersey and the East Coast to come to Caltech. She helped launch the inaugural season for women's soccer at Caltech in 2017 and says the sport and the team teach lessons that help her in the classroom and on the field. The chemical engineering major is inspired by the researchers and professors on campus, and she is committed to building a legacy for other young women at Caltech.",
